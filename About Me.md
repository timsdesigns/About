## About Me
<br>

### [`Prelude`]
<p></p>
While executing designs a carpenter I developed the urge to improve the buildings I was involved with.  
In my <a href="https://issuu.com/home/published/portfolio_tim_fischer__en_">Bachelor</a> I then <a href="https://www.ciee.org/go-abroad/college-study-abroad/programs/germany/berlin/global-architecture-design#academics">discovered computational design tools</a> in my <a href="https://www.archip.eu/">semester abroad</a> and have been convinced of their merit ever since.
<br/>
<br/>

### [`MSC studies`]
<p></p>
After some freelance work and internships and competitions in architecture, workshops and further work in <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/153258593">3D Printing</a> and Vizualisation, in my Masters I focused on <a href="https://issuu.com/timfischer45/docs/grasshopper_polimi_p1-17_01">exploration of various fields</a> utilizing and discovering these tools as i.a.  

- material research,
- <a href="https://vimeo.com/219884392">applied mathematics</a>,
- <a href="https://issuu.com/timfischer45/docs/extreme_living_-_functional_unit_-_">bending active systems</a>,
- <a href="https://vimeo.com/226139359">physics simulation</a>,
- <a href="https://vimeo.com/247093054">agent based simulation</a>, 
- urban analysis,
- structural analysis/optimization,
- energy optimization (<a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/257005791">PV-Cells</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/257005791">Envelope</a>),
- seismic analysis
- and 3D printing (scale models & prototypes).
<br/>

### [`MSC work`]
<p></p>
Simultaneously it was important to me to <a href="https://vimeo.com/236308356"><b>fieldtest some of these techniques</b></a>, which was enabled through an internship and later a <a href="http://www.textilearchitecture.polimi.it/#research">software developer/ computational designer</a> associate position.
The work, besides allowing to <b>develop robust workflows and</b> eventually <b>defined tools for reusability and interoperability</b> <b>focused</b> besides development <b>on presentation and communication</b> to/with collegues, office leaders, manufactoring companies abroad, investors and patent reseearch/work.  
I was also able to further develop my skills whithin an <b>independent international collaboration</b> on our contribution to the <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/world-writing-museum"><b>World Writing Museum Competition</b></a> <b>GSM import, SubD, custom tool dev, Vray</b>) and on the <b>EVOLO Skyscraper Competition</b> (<b>generative design, physics simulation, smart slabs</b>).

### [`Coding`]
<p></p>
One main subject of my extra curriculars was learning <a href="https://vimeo.com/247048808">scripting within Grasshopper for Rhino3d</a>.  
This was followed by a deeper dive into the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/learning-paths/learning-path-c/9781491987186/">C# Programming language</a> and <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/weeks/0/">Programming in general</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

### [`ComDeCom`]
<p></p>
After my studies I founded <a href="https://www.comdecon.com">ComDeCon</a> (Computational Design Consulting) offering several differently scoped services around digital transformation. So far I've been involved with a <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/allprojects">row of projects</a> covering:

* <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/productdesign">3D Printing</a> (Grip Handle, 3d printing on fabric, Maciachini Model and Furniture Models),  
* <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/furniture">Structural Optimization</a> (Forced Based Furniture),  
* <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/graphicdesign">Vizualisation</a> (Ophthalmology Research, Street Renveal),  
* <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/urbandesign">Grasshopper Solutions</a> (Urban Shadow Generation, Honeycomb Geometry, Wave Frames Ceiling, Twisted Base Skyscraper, Butterfly Terminal),  
* <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/infrastructuredesign">Civil Enineering Tool development</a> (RFI- GIS- Import and RFI- CAD workflow automation),  
* <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/319545166">Concept/ sketching/ sub-d modeling and structural optimization</a> (Force Based Furniture,  triply gemoetric landscape),  
* <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/allprojects">Reverse engineering/ modeling</a> (Maciachini Model),  
* <a href="">Design options/ consultation and 3d visualization/ virtual walkthrough</a> (Apartment Milano).

### [`IASS Conference and Assasin Bug`]
<p></p>
Initially for the graduation project I was researching <a href="https://www.livestreamevent.uk/iass2021/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/08/975.pdf">Resposive Systems in Seismic Computational Design</a>, which was selected and proudly made it into the international Conference on Spatial Structures IASS in Surrey this year.  
As a main outcome besides the workflow stands now the parametric component, that produces the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp45P_SOf4U">performing structure for testing</a> and is now under development to be published on <a href="https://www.food4rhino.com">Food4Rhino</a> and to be made an open source GitHub repository.
<br/>
<br/>

### [`Software Development`]
<p></p>
As part of this work and growing interest to work in developing architectural software, I have undergone several months in a series of further intensive classes about software development:  

* <a href="https://www.alfatraining.de/gefoerderte-weiterbildung/berlinmitte/stadt/berlin-mitte/kurs/relationale-datenbanken-sql/N/0/0/kombi/relationale-datenbanken-sql/#pos1">SQL and relational Databases</a> (1 month),  
* <a href="https://www.alfatraining.de/gefoerderte-weiterbildung/berlinmitte/stadt/berlin-mitte/kurs/visual-cnet/N/0/0/kombi/c-entwickler-in/#pos1">C# .NET development with Windows Forms</a> (2 month)  
<p></p>
and have used the final projects to practice agile methods using

- Sprint; Timeboxing: Planning Poker/ T-shirt sizing, Impediment Backlog and <a href="https://www.burndownfortrello.com/index.php#"> Burndowncharts (Trello)</a> and also
- Teamwork via <a href="https://github.com/Computational-Design-Consulting">Github</a> (Markdown Documentation).  

<p></p>
Then followed some online classes and books on

- <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Distilled-Computational-Problems/dp/0997316020">Datatypes and Datastructures</a>,
- Algorithms,
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3P8c87cwk">Unit Tests (C#)</a>,
- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS (in Progress)</a>,
- currently I am catching up on <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tutorials/?ref=lbp">Networks</a>
- and Plan to tackle <a href="">Javascript</a> to cover web development as well.  
<br/>

### [`Architecture & Computational Design`]
<p></p>
I'm maintaining constant practice in discovering the depth of <a href="">RhinoCommon</a> and the <a href="">Grasshopper SDK</a>. And I am building several small Plugins while finalizing some previous conceptual <a href="https://timsdesigns.wixsite.com/cdconsulting/expo-2020">work</a> to present in my Portfolio/Website in form of renderings via Twinmotion.
